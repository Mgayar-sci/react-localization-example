## To see the Production Version

### If you want to see the build version or production version is okay for localization in the development environment. Install the package below
```npm install --global serve```
### Serve is a lightweight web server,  so we can run our production build through this serve npm package. Then build the production-ready react app by following command
```npm run build```
### By this command it creates the build the folder in the root of the project with necessary html , js , assets , css file with a minimized version. Then run the following command to run the production version react app locally
```serve -s build```
